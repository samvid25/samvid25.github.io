<div style="text-align:center;">
<span>Hi!</span>
</div>

<p>I'm a graduate student pursuing an MS in Information Networking at <a href="https://www.cmu.edu/">Carnegie Mellon University</a>. Prior to this, I worked at <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-india/">Microsoft Research India</a> as a Research Fellow. I obtained my bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Engineering from <a href="https://www.nitk.ac.in/">National Institute of Technology Karnataka</a> in India.

<p>I am interested in using formal verification techniques to write safe and secure code. I am also interested in blockchains, distributed systems, cryptography and compilers. In my free time, I also enjoy learning about chess engines and algorithms for efficient representation and storage of games.</p>

<p style="font-weight:bold">I'm actively looking for internship opportunities for the summer of 2022. Please <span class="tooltip">reach out<span class="tooltiptext no-underline">
