<p>Hi! I'm a graduate student pursuing an MS in Information Networking at <a href="https://www.cmu.edu/">Carnegie Mellon
        University</a>. Prior to this, I worked at <a
        href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-india/">Microsoft Research India</a> as a
    Research Fellow in the Programming Languages and Software Engineering group. I obtained my bachelor's degree in
    Computer Science and Engineering from <a href="https://www.nitk.ac.in/">National Institute of Technology
        Karnataka</a> in India.</p>

<p>My research interests include using formal verification and other automated reasoning techniques to improve software
    and system security. I have interned at <a href="https://www.certik.com/company/about">CertiK</a> this summer
    exploring its use to prove the safety of blockchain smart contracts (continuing my work at MSR). Currently, I am
    working with <a href="https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/bparno/">Bryan Parno</a> on applying these techniques to
    formally verify the security of cryptographic protocols. I am also interested in program analysis, programming
    language theory and compilers.</p>

<p>When I'm not working, I'm almost always playing <span class="tooltip">chess <span class="tooltiptext">Challenge me to
            a game <a href="https://lichess.org/@/Samvid25">here!</a></span></span>. I also like to read fiction, play
    the guitar and draw.
